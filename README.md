# Backup S3

Misc backup scripts to take offsite backups to S3 compatible clouds, such as AWS S3, Oracle Cloud Infra, Linode, DigitalOcean, etc.

Currently the following apps are supported...

- [Laravel](https://github.com/pothi/backup-s3/tree/main/laravel)
- [phpBB](https://github.com/pothi/backup-s3/tree/main/phpbb)
- [XenForo](https://github.com/pothi/backup-s3/tree/main/xenforo)

If you are looking for scripts to backup your WordPress sites to S3 compatible clouds, check out [Backup WP S3](https://github.com/pothi/backup-wordpress) that is actually the base for this repo, modified to fit the requirements of Laravel, phpBB, etc.
